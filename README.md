# The Ancient Art Of DOS Batch Files (Reprint) #

In December of 2011, I posed [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8540462/ancient-art-of-dos-batch-files) to the StackOverflow community:

>Years ago I had a document titled "The Ancient Art of DOS Batch Files". It was posted on the internet and widely distributed. Recently, I have been unable to find my copy of it - digital or otherwise - and every search I've done points me to a site that no longer exists (http://gatsby.tafe.tas.edu.au/batch/).
>
>Can anyone point me to where I can get a copy of this?
>
>Thank you in advance for your help.

While no satisfactory answer was ever provided, I recently uncovered my original copy while cleaning out my home office, and have decided to reproduce it here in it's original for others. Once I've accomplished that, I'll be going through and updating it as needed for modern usage.

*A license will be added as soon as I figure out what, if any license applies.*
